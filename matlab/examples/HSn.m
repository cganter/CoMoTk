function out = HSn( in )
% HSn
%
% Returns hyperbolic secant (HSn) pulse in the linear rapid passage region
% based upon D. Idiyatullin et al., JMR 193 (2008) 267â€“273
% Supports gapped pulses with reduced duty cycle
%
% Input:
% 
% in.n = order of HSn pulse [no unit] (optional, default value == 1):
%
% At least *two* of the following three parameters (specifying duration and bandwidth)
% need to be specified.
% Their presence is checked in the following order
% (no check for inconsistent settings, if all three parameters are
% supplied):
%
% in.Tp = pulse duration [ms]
% in.bw = pulse bandwidth [kHz]
% in.R = time bandwidth product [no unit] (R = Tp * bw)
%
% flip angle for rapid passage HSn pulses:
%
% in.fa = flip angle [deg]
%
% the RF pulse is specified for rapid passage.
% Adiabatic pulses can be simulated, if the following optional value
% (default == 1)
%
% in.rapid 
%
% is set to a value < 1. (omega_1_max is divided by this value)
%
% Discretization of RF pulse:
%
% The RF pulse is assumed to be split into N_tot = N_seg * L_over parts
% each with constant B1+. 
% To satisfy the Nyquist condition, N_tot must be larger than R.
% For gapped pulses, the duty cycle d_c defines the fraction of B1+
% transmission and N_seg the number of gaps. 
% Consequently, HSn pulses without gap correspond to d_c == 1
% To avoid rounding errors, L_over * d_c should be an integer.
% We let gapped pulses start with a transmit part and end with a gap.
%
% in.L_over = oversampling factor [integer, no unit]
% in.N_seg = number of segments [no unit]
% in.d_c = duty cycle [no unit]
%
% Output:
%
% out.t = time points, related flip angles and phases [ms]
% out.alpha = flip angle train (length( alpha ) == L_over * N_seg + 1)
% out.phi = associated phases
% out.t_int = center times of small intervals
% out.omega_1_max = max. amplitude of omega_1
% out.omega_1 = time-dependent RF amplitude [rad * kHz]
% out.omega_RF = time-dependent RF frequency [rad * kHz]
% out.dw = dwell time (== Tp / N_seg)
% out.dt = oversampled time interval (== dw / L_over)
% out.n_B1 = number of transmit periods per dwell time (== L_over * d_c)
% out.n_gap = receive intervals per dwell time (== L_over - n_B1)
% out.a = frequency acceleration [kHz/ms] (== (d/dt omega_RF)/(2*pi))
